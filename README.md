Webservice written in Java

The code can be packed into a WAR file and can be run on (for example) an Apache Tomcat Server.
IME files in the IME xml format (example given for Akkadian cuneiform) should be put in the folder "ime" located above the webserver execution folder. (e.g. tomcat/webapps)

Happy testing!
